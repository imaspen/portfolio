# My Role
I worked as the lead programmer, implementing most of the gameplay systems, such as the level generation, AI, and player controls.

# Demo Notes
This game features some flashing screens. This may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. Discretion is advised.

The aim is to kill all the enemies on a level, then head down the trapdoor to the second level. At the end of the second level is a boss, which requires you to punch the amulet to spawn the next wave.

## Controls
The menu relies on mouse controls, but the game is played with a controller.

Left stick: Move
Right stick: Aim
Right trigger: Attack
Right bumper: Use door
